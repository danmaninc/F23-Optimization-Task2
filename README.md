# Interior-Point Algorithm

## About the Project
This project implements the Interior-Point algorithm,
a widely used method for solving linear programming problems.
Linear programming involves optimizing a linear objective function,
subject to a set of linear inequality constraints.
The Interior-Point algorithm iteratively improves the randomly generated initial solution
until an optimal solution is reached.

## Run

1. Switch to the `main` branch
2. Make sure CMake is installed on your device
3. Compile all files and execute main.cpp
4. Follow the instructions provided by the program to input the necessary problem parameters and constraints.

## Testing
